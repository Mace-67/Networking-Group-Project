# Networking-Group-Project
This is a networking project, where a user and client are able to communicate back and forth between eachother

-Will need the Colorama library for python and the cryptography library as well

To use: 

1.) First run the key generation file to generate your private keys
2.)Then run the start file
3.) Then run the Server file, it should connect and say waiting on client 
4.) Thhen run the client, it should connect to the server and both can then communicate to eachother.
